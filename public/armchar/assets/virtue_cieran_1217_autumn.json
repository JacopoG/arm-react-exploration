This gives you the Virtue Second Sight (see page 48) at no cost, and you can see normally in darkness or semi-darkness, such as in deep woods or at night. Your eyes look mostly normal, but are an unusual and vivid color. </p><p> Third, you may learn Faerie Lore during character generation. </p><p> Finally, you get the benefits of a particular type of fay heritage, as given in the Virtue Faerie Blood (page 42). Your specific fay her- itage is clearly visible. Choose one physical quirk, such as small horns, literally blue blood, or eyes without irises and pupils, appropriate to the faeries from which you are descended. </p><p> You may not have both Faerie Blood and Strong Faerie Blood. </p><p> This is a Supernatural Virtue, and you cannot lose it when being trained as a magus (see page 106).
